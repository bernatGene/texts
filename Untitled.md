there's something i need to tell you
about something that will happen next week
but it might not happen so I won't tell you yet
I;ll just wait a little more

Maybe the sky fall on us,
I might have not wake up tomorrow
so why would I bother you now?
if it might be for nothing?

Therefore I will wait, just a little more
just to make sure than when I do
finally decide to tell you
it will be too late anyway.
