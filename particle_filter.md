 
Particle filter 
 
Float away, 
Dissolve, dissipate, diffuse, 
evaporate, melt, 
or, radiate into the void. 
Vanish, yet remain. 
 
Formless, boundless, careless 
transparent, and out of reach. 
 
Fleeting vortices of air, 
more buoyant than a cloud. 
A distant fading memory, 
a haze that blurs the mind. 
 
Float away, float away.
