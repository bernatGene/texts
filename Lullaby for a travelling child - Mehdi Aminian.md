My love, remain a child  
The world will force you to grow  
Whether you are a lamb or not,  
The wolf will turn you into a wolf  
The world is a coloured pencil,  
even if you are the best painter  
The world will still paint you  
My love, remain a child  
You will be sick and tired of the world if you grow up  
It is so cruel that the moment you forget your childhood,  
it will turn you into a stone.
